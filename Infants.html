        <h1 id="infant-title">Infants 0-18 Months</h1>
        <p id="inf-1">Each day is a journey for your new infant at Starlight Academy. Here, we have created an 
        individualized environment that provides each infant with the intellectual stimulation for development.
        Our rooms and curriculum is created with your infants needs in mind. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="infant-benefits">Benefits for Your Infant</h3>
        <ul id="benefits">
           <li>
            Separate eating, sleeping and learning schedules based on their needs
           </li>
           <li>
            A classroom filled with toys and books geared towards helping infants develop at their own pace
           </li>
           <li>
            A separate, enclosed area of the classroom that ensures a safe environment for newborns
           </li>
           <li>
            Daily activities that develop new and creative skills
           </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="inf-2">From the moment you and your child set foot in the door, expect to be greeted immediately 
        with the care and courtesy you deserve. One of our friendly teachers will welcome you to the classroom and 
        help you get accustomed to the physical layout and routine of the day. Each infant enrolled in our program 
        will be given their own individually labeled crib, and no two infants will ever share the same crib. Are you 
        worried about cleanliness at our center? Worry no longer: All sheets and blankets are washed daily on site, creating 
        the cleanest possible environment for your child.</p>
        <p id="inf-3">When you put your trust in our learning center, 
        you can rest assured that we will treat your infant as if he or she were our own. We provide Parent's Choice formula, 
        baby food, rice cereal, and nutritional snacks - all of which are included within the tuition rate. At the end of the day, 
        every parent will receive a report that provides them with information regarding their child's feeding, diapering, 
        and sleeping times. We will also keep you verbally informed on every aspect of your child's day, and are glad to answer any questions 
        you may have.</p>
